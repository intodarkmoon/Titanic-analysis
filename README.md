# Data Preparation

Data Preparation is the process of gathering, combining, structuring, and organizing data so it can be used in business intelligence (BI), analytics, and data visualization applications. The components of data preparation include data preprocessing, profiling, cleansing, validation, and transformation.

1. ### Data Cleansing
Data Cleansing is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.. 

Before we carry out the data cleansing process, there are several things that must be considered, including:
- Import the required libraries 
    - **pandas**, for data manipulation and analysis
    - **NumPy**, used for working with arrays
    - **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization

2.	### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

Before we carry out the data cleansing process, there are 2 libraries that must be imported, including:
- pandas, for data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn, for determining the relationship between two variables

Types of Exploratory Data Analysis.
- **Univariate-Non-Graphic Analysis**, is the simplest form of data analysis, in which the analyzed data consists of only one variable so that it does not deal with causes or relationships. The main purpose of the univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns in it.
- **Univariate-Graphic analysis**, this method is needed because non-graphical methods cannot provide a complete picture of the data. Examples of graphs that are often used are steam and leaf, histogram, boxplot, etc.
- **Multivariate-Non-Graphic Analysis** is a form of analysis that uses two or more variables, so Exploratory Data Analysis is used to show the relationship between these variables.
- **Multivariate-Graphic Analysis**, using graphs to show the relationship between variables. Examples of graphs that can be used scatter plots, run charts, heat maps, bubble charts, etc.
